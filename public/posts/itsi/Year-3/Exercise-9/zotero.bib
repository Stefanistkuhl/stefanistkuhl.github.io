	abstract = {{NetBIOS} () is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output
	            System. It provides services related to the session layer of
	            the {OSI} model allowing applications on separate computers
	            to communicate over a local area network. As strictly an {API
	            }, {NetBIOS} is not a networking protocol. Operating systems
	            of the 1980s ({DOS} and Novell Netware primarily) ran {
	            NetBIOS} over {IEEE} 802.2 and {IPX}/{SPX} using the {NetBIOS
	            } Frames ({NBF}) and {NetBIOS} over {IPX}/{SPX} ({NBX})
	            protocols, respectively. In modern networks, {NetBIOS}
	            normally runs over {TCP}/{IP} via the {NetBIOS} over {TCP}/{
	            IP} ({NBT}) protocol. {NetBIOS} is also used for identifying
	            system names in {TCP}/{IP} (Windows).},

	            a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a
	            network connection. The user employs {RDP} client software
	            for this purpose, while the other computer must run {RDP}
	            server software. Several clients exist for most versions of
	            Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile but the support
	            has ended), Linux (for example Remmina), Unix, {macOS}, {iOS}
	            , Android, and other operating systems. {RDP} servers are
	            built into the server and professional editions of Windows
	            operating systems but not home editions; an {RDP} server for
	            Unix and {OS} X also exists (for example xrdp). By default,
	            the server listens on {TCP} port 3389 and {UDP} port 3389.
	            Microsoft currently refers to their official {RDP} client
	            software as Remote Desktop Connection, formerly "Terminal
	            Services Client". The protocol is an extension of the {ITU}-T
	            T.128 application sharing protocol. Microsoft makes some
	            specifications public on their website.},
